# Backend CRUD Based Project
### About Project:
- Built a RESTful API that can get/create/update/delete user data from a persistence database.
- The API should follow typical RESTful API design patterns.
● The data should be saved in the DB.
● Also there is a requirement where the user instances need to link to each other, i.e., a list
of "followers/following" or "friends". Design the model structure and the API you would
build for querying or modifying it.
● Related to the requirement above, suppose the address of user now includes a
geographic coordinate(i.e. latitude and longitude), build an API that,
○ given a user’s name
○ return the nearby friends
● Provide proper unit tests.
● Provide proper API documentation.

### Steps to run the project
- Clone the project to your local system
- Install all the dependencies using "npm install" command
- Run the server using "npm run dev" command and start using the API.
